# What is this project? üö©

This project basically aims to recreate original Half-Life map source files very close to the original. You shouldn't be expecting 1:1 similarities with actual source. Geometry and lightning may differ.

# Small reminder üîî

I don't recommend using unofficial RAD compilers because lightning will be so much different than original game. You can find
Valve's original RAD compiler on QRAD folder in repository or Half-Life SDK.

Make sure to compile maps with .RAD file and final mode (Full VIS and Extra RAD). If there's no .RAD file for the map, it doesn't need it.

# Contribution  ü§ù

Contributions are appricated! You can contribute by fixing bugs, inconsistencies in map sources on the repository. If there's no RMF for a map, please do not submit RMF's. Wait me to do them.
