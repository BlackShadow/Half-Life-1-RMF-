# What is this project?

This project basically aims to recreate original Half-Life map source files to very close to original.

Side Note: I don't recommend using Valve Hammer Editor with original compilers. You may have unexpected results while compiling. J.A.C.K Editor is recommended. Also lightning may look different since you're not going to use original Valve's RAD compilers.

Make sure to compile maps with their .RAD file. If there's no .RAD file for the map, it doesn't need it.
