This project aims to recreate original Half-Life map source files from various sources.

Side Note: I don't recommend using original Valve Hammer Editor with original compilers. You may have unexpected results while compiling. J.A.C.K Editor is recommended. Also lightning may look different since you're not going to use original Valve RAD compilers.

Make sure compile maps with their .RAD file. If there's no .RAD file for the map, it doesn't need it.
