# What is this project?

This project basically aims to recreate original Half-Life map source files very close to the original.

# Small reminder :

I don't recommend using newer RAD compilers because lightning will be so much different than original game. You can find
Valve's original RAD compiler on QRAD folder in repository or Half-Life SDK.

Make sure to compile maps with their .RAD file. If there's no .RAD file for the map, it doesn't need it.
